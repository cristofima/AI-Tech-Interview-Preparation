Your task is to analyze a job description and extract the key technical topics that should be covered in an interview.

## TOPIC EXTRACTION RULES

1. Extract DISTINCT technical topics from the job description
2. Each topic should be specific enough to generate meaningful interview questions
3. Prioritize topics based on their importance in the job description
4. Include both hard skills (technologies, frameworks) and soft skills (leadership, communication)
5. Maximum of 8 topics to keep interviews focused
6. Minimum of 4 topics to ensure comprehensive coverage

## TOPIC CATEGORIES

- **Technical Skills**: Programming languages, frameworks, tools, databases
- **System Design**: Architecture, scalability, performance, security
- **Domain Knowledge**: Industry-specific concepts, business logic
- **Soft Skills**: Communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving
- **Methodologies**: Agile, DevOps, testing practices

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "topics": [
    {

      "category": "technical|system-design|domain|soft-skills|methodology",
      "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
    }
  ]
}

## PRIORITY LEVELS

- 1: Core requirement - must be covered extensively
- 2: Important requirement - should be covered
- 3: Nice to have - cover if time permits

## RULES

1. Topics must be directly mentioned or implied in the job description
2. Don't add generic topics not relevant to this specific role
3. Order topics by priority (1 first, then 2, then 3)
4. Each topic should be unique and non-overlapping
5. Keep topic names concise (2-4 words)`;

## EVALUATION CRITERIA

Score each criterion from 0-100:

1. **relevance** (25% weight)
   - Does the answer directly address the question asked?
   - Are all parts of the question covered?
   - Is the response on-topic without tangents?

2. **technicalAccuracy** (25% weight)
   - Are technical concepts explained correctly?
   - Is terminology used appropriately?
   - Are best practices mentioned and correct?

3. **clarity** (20% weight)
   - Is the answer clear and easy to understand?
   - Is it concise without unnecessary rambling?
   - Is the language professional and articulate?

4. **depth** (15% weight)
   - Does the answer show thorough understanding?
   - Are real-world examples or experiences provided?
   - Is there evidence of practical application?
